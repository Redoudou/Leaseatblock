## Project Name: Lease At Block 

### Medium term goal : 
Present this project to the NYCEDC and the think tank New America to get funding. Building a simple solution that can be easily implemented to any city in the world.
 
### The context:
-About 1 million apartments are rent-stabilized in NYC, that's roughly half of all apartments in the city. 
-Rent Stabilization giver renters the right to stay in their apartment with modest rent increases each year, typically between 2 - 6%.

### The Problem we will tackle:
Since 1990, we estimate New York City has lost 300 000 rent-stabilized apartments. A lot of tenants do not know they are in a rent-controlled apartment and thus are being abused by realtors.  The city lacks a system that tracks rent-stabilized. It’s almost impossible to know if an apartment is under that regulation or not. 

### Do we need a Blockchain ?

We need a database
There is multiple writers
Landlords ,Tenants and City have conflicting interests.
We can’t rely on a third party.

⇒ we have a Blockchain use case !
