# Lease At Block 
Lease at Block put Rent-stabilized lease into a secured, immutable and traceable blockchain. 

[The Gitcoin Virtual Hackathon Decentralized Impact Incubator](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/onboard/decentralized-impact-incubator/) is an on-line hackathon sponsored by [Blockchain for Social Impact](blockchainforsocialimpact.com/). 
From February 18th till March 31st team will develop a product to resolve the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals number 11 :

 - [Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11)
 
 We will be building a solution that apply to New York regulation rent laws but we are looking to expand this inovation to any city.

### After the Hackathon : 
Present this project to the [NYCEDC](https://edc.nyc/) and the think tank [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/) to get funding. 
 
### The context:
A product of nearly 100 years of advocacy and legislation, rent regulation is critical for low-income New Yorkers.
Rent regulation mediates the severe power imbalance between tenants and landlords, which is exacerbated by tight housing markets. The rent laws, similar to anti-trust laws, consumer protections and other regulatory laws, are especially important for low-income people but benefit moderate-income households as well. They differ from—but often complement—housing subsidy programs. For example, by mediating rent levels.

- About 1 million apartments are rent-stabilized in NYC, that's roughly half of all apartments in the city. 
- Rent Stabilization giver renters the right to stay in their apartment with modest rent increases each year, typically between 2 - 6%.

### The Problem we tackle:
Since 1990, we estimate New York City has lost 300 000 rent-stabilized apartments. A lot of tenants do not know they are in a rent-controlled apartment and thus are being abused by realtors.  The city lacks a system that tracks rent-stabilized. It’s almost impossible to know if an apartment is under that regulation or not. 

### Do we need a Blockchain ?
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/PFq09Yx/Screenshot-from-2019-10-14-01-48-54.png)

 - We need a database to store the leases There is multiple writers :
 - Landlord , Tenants, City Landlords ,Tenants and City have conflicting interests. 
 - We can’t rely on a third party = Some of the information needs to be public

⇒ we have a Blockchain use case !
