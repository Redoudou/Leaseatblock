# Lease On The Block 
### Lease on the Block is contract management system specific for low income housing in New York City. It stores the lease in a unique, a secured, immutable and traceable blockchain. Bottom line, we want to link a rent-sabilized lease with the affordable housing tax incentives that the developer benefited. (LIHTC, j51, 421a....)

### The context:
A product of nearly 100 years of advocacy and legislation, rent regulation is critical for low-income New Yorkers.
Rent regulation mediates the severe power imbalance between tenants and landlords, which is exacerbated by tight housing markets. The rent laws, similar to anti-trust laws, consumer protections and other regulatory laws, are especially important for low-income people but benefit moderate-income households as well. They differ from—but often complement—housing subsidy programs. For example, by mediating rent levels.

- About 1 million apartments are rent-regulated in NYC, that's roughly half of all apartments in the city. 
- Rent Stabilization giver renters the right to stay in their apartment with modest rent increases each year, typically between 2 - 6%.

### The Problem we tackle:

Since 1990, we estimate New York City has lost 300 000 rent-stabilized apartments. A lot of tenants do not know they are in a rent-controlled apartment and thus are being abused by realtors. The city lacks a system that tracks rent-stabilized. It’s almost impossible to know if an apartment is under that regulation or not. Systems between various agency NYSHA, HCR, HPDP, NYCHDC do not share information and can't always communicate. Thanks to Blockchain technology Lease On the Block preserve privacy while offering shared and unified data across the agencies.  

### Do we need a Blockchain ?
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/PFq09Yx/Screenshot-from-2019-10-14-01-48-54.png)

 - We need a database to store the leases There is multiple writers :
 - Landlord , Tenants, City Landlords ,Tenants and City have conflicting interests. 
 - We can’t rely on a third party = Some of the information needs to be public

⇒ we have a Blockchain use case !
