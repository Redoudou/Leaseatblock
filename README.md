Rent Stabilization giver renters the right to stay in their apartment with modest rent increases each year, typically between 2 - 6%.<br><br></span><span class="c7">The Problem we will tackle</span><span>:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since 1990, we estimate New York City has lost 300 000 rent-stabilized apartments. A lot of tenants do not know they are in a rent-controlled apartment and thus are being abused by realtors. &nbsp;The city lacks a system that tracks rent-stabilized. It’s almost impossible to know if an apartment is under that regulation or not. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">Solution</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We need a database</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is multiple writers</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Landlords ,Tenants and City have conflicting interests.<br>We can’t rely on a third party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">⇒ we have a Blockchain use case !
